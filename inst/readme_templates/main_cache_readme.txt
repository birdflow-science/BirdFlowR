This directory was created by the R BirdFlowR Package to cache models
downloaded from remote collections so they do not have to be redownloaded every
time they are used.

It is safe to delete with two caveots:
  1. You will need to redownload models if you use them again - not a big deal.
  2. If you have out-of-date models that you would like to use without updating
    you should not delete them as only up-to-date models are available for
    download.

Unless it's been manually deleted there should be at least one sub-directory
with a 6 character name that contains the cached files for a specific remote
directory.
