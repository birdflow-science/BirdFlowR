This directory was created by the R BirdFlowR Package to cache models
downloaded from a specific remote collection:
  [collection_url]
so they do not have to be redownloaded every time they are used.

It is safe to delete with two caveots:
  1. You will need to redownload models if you use them again - not a big deal.
  2. If you have out-of-date models that you would like to use without updating
    you should not delete them as only up-to-date models are available for
    download.

For more information consult the manual for BirdFlowR available online:
