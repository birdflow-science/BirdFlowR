\title{Load the index to a remote model collection}
\usage{
load_collection_index(
  update = TRUE,
  collection_url = birdflow_options("collection_url")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{update}{If \code{TRUE} (the default) then both the index and cached model file
are checked against the server's version to make sure they are up-to-date and
downloaded again if they are not.
If \code{FALSE} then neither the index nor the model will be checked.
Set to \code{FALSE} after downloading the model(s) you need if you want to make
sure the model does not change during your analysis (even if updated on
the server); or if working offline.}

\item{collection_url}{The url of a collection. Should be the path to
the base directory (not an index.html file).}
}
\value{
A data frame with a row for every model in the collection.
}
\description{
Load the collection index for the current model collection.  This function
will return an up-to-date index for the current BirdFlow collection. It
caches the index locally and will update the cached version if it is not
up-to-date.
}
\details{
The collection will default to the main BirdFlow model collection and most
users will not need to set it.

The local cache directory (for all collections) defaults to
\href{birdflow_otions()}{birdflow_options("cache")} the cache directory for the
current collection will be in a subdirectory.  Both of the above options
can be changed for the duration of the session with \code{\link[=birdflow_options]{birdflow_options()}},
but the defaults should be suitable for most users.
