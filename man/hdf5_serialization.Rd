\usage{
read_Rotues(obj_path)

write_Rotues(obj, obj_path)

read_BirdFlowRotues(obj_path)

write_BirdFlowRotues(obj, obj_path)

read_BirdFlowIntervals(obj_path)

write_BirdFlowIntervals(obj, obj_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj_path}{The path to write}

\item{obj}{The BirdFlowIntervals object to write}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item \code{write_*} functions invisibly return their input object (after
writing to disk).
\item \code{read_*} functions return the reconstructed R object,
with S3 class attributes and Date columns restored where applicable.
}
}
\description{
These functions provide a convenient interface for writing arbitrary R
objects to HDF5 files and reading them back, preserving S3 class
metadata. Specialized helpers are provided for common BirdFlow-related
objects (routes and intervals), automatically restoring Date columns.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \strong{write_r_object_h5} and \strong{read_r_object_h5} are internal workhorses:
they handle the recursive traversal of R lists (including data.frames,
Date/POSIX/Facter vectors) and store both data and class attributes
in the HDF5 file hierarchy.
\item The higher-level helpers (\strong{read_Rotues}, \strong{write_Rotues},
\strong{read_BirdFlowRotues}, \strong{write_BirdFlowRotues},
\strong{read_BirdFlowIntervals},
\strong{write_BirdFlowIntervals}) wrap these internals to provide
suppressed warnings and post-processing such as coercing date columns
back to \code{Date} objects.
