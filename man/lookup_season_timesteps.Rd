\title{Lookup breeding, non-breeding, or migration season timesteps}
\usage{
lookup_season_timesteps(x, season, season_buffer = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a BirdFlow object}

\item{season}{one of the seasons
returned by \code{\link[=species_info]{species_info()}}, a season alias, or  or \code{"all"}
for all timesteps in the model}

\item{season_buffer}{the number of extra timesteps to add to the beginning
and end of the season.}
}
\value{
a series of integers indicating which timesteps correspond with the
(possibly buffered) season.
}
\description{
Retrieve the timesteps associated with a season for the species modeled by
a BirdFlow object, possibly with a buffer (in timesteps) added on. Seasons
dates are from \link[ebirdst:ebirdst_runs]{ebirdst::ebirdst_runs} and are directly accessible
with \code{\link[=species_info]{species_info()}}.
