\title{Function to validate a BirdFlow object}
\usage{
validate_BirdFlow(x, error = TRUE, allow_incomplete = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a BirdFlow object}

\item{error}{if TRUE throw an error if there are problems if FALSE return
any problems as a data.frame.}

\item{allow_incomplete}{if TRUE allow the BirdFlow object to be missing
both marginals and transitions (but not other components). This allows
checking the output of \code{\link[=preprocess_species]{preprocess_species()}}.}
}
\value{
If \code{error = FALSE} the function returns
a data.frame describing any errors with columns:
\describe{
\item{problem}{a character description of any problems}
\item{type}{the problem type, either "error" or "incomplete"}
}
Otherwise, if there are no problems a similar data.frame with no rows is
returned invisibly.
}
\description{
Throw an error if a BirdFlow object is malformed or incomplete.
}
\details{
\code{\link[=preprocess_species]{preprocess_species()}} creates a BirdFlow object that lacks both marginals
and transitions and thus can't be used to make projections.
\code{validate_BirdFlow()} tags the absence of these with the type "incomplete".
Any other missing or malformed components are tagged "error".

Since marginals can be used to calculate both distributions and
transition matrices, a BirdFlow object can be complete if it has marginals;
or has both transitions and distributions. Having redundancy in these three
is not considered an error.

Currently metadata and species information is not checked for completeness.

Currently dead end transitions are permitted.  See \code{\link[=find_dead_ends]{find_dead_ends()}} for
checking for those.
