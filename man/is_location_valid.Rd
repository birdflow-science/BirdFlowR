\title{Are locations and distributions covered by the model for the given time}
\usage{
is_location_valid(bf, i, x, y, timestep, date)

is_distr_valid(bf, distr, timestep, date, return_mask = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{bf}{A BirdFlow object.}

\item{i}{State space index (location).}

\item{x}{X coordinates in the \code{bf}'s CRS (\link[terra:crs]{crs(bf)}).}

\item{y}{T coordinate.}

\item{timestep}{The timestep.}

\item{date}{Date in any format accepted by \code{\link[=lookup_timestep]{lookup_timestep()}}.}

\item{distr}{One or more distributions in vector or matrix form representing
a probability for each active cell in the model.}

\item{return_mask}{If TRUE return a mask with the same dimensions as \code{distr}
which is TRUE for all cells that can have valid non-zero values. This is
conditioned on the timestep associated with each distribution.}
}
\value{
A logical vector, 'TRUE\verb{if valid}FALSE\verb{otherwise with values for each input location or distribution. See}return_mask` for an exception.
}
\description{
A location or and time is valid if the model has a non zero probability  of
movement into and out of that location at that time. An invalid state
either has zero probability of movement into and out of it, or isn't covered
by the model at all. Similarly distributions are valid if all of the
probability is in cells for which movement is modeled.
}
\details{
For \code{is_location_valid()} there are 2 ways of inputting locations. Only
one should be used: either \code{i} a vector of location indices
(see \code{\link[=xy_to_i]{xy_to_i()}}), or \code{x} and \code{y}.

For both functions time should be input either as \code{timestep} or \code{date}.

The number of timesteps or dates should either be 1 or match to the number
of locations or distributions; if singular it will be applied to all.

A location is invalid if any of the following apply:
\enumerate{
\item The location isn't in the model extent.
\item The location doesn't correspond to an active cell in the model;
it's masked out by the static mask.
\item The location isn't a valid state at the given timestep or date; it's
excluded by the dynamic mask or by state or other sparsification see
\code{\link[=sparsify]{sparsify()}}.
\item The timestep isn't valid, or the date doesn't have an associated
timestep. The second applies only to BirdFlow models that don't cover the
whole year.
}

A distribution is invalid for similar reasons but applied to all the
locations that have non-zero values.

\examples{

bf <- BirdFlowModels::amewoo
timestep  <- 3

# Sample two valid locations from a distribution
distr <- get_distr(bf, timestep, from_marginals = TRUE)
locs <- sample_distr(distr, n = 2)
i <- apply(locs, 2, function(x) which(as.logical(x)))
is_location_valid(bf, i, timestep = timestep)

# Sample a few invalid locations
i <- sample(which(distr == 0), 2)
is_location_valid(bf, i, timestep = timestep)

}
